<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Dubravka and recently I started to get into coding and programing.I always wanted the freedom to work form anywhere and to build something. </p>

<p>Programing gives me that freedom, and the more I learn the more I am amazed how a begginer like me can build web pages and create in virtual world.</p>

<p>This is my portfolio of all the coding I learned so far. I only hope that I will be better and better as the time goes by. I am excited about the things I am going to learn and what possibilites are ahead of me.</p>
